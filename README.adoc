== Honey bees 

=== Male and female castes

A colony generally contains one queen bee, a female; seasonally up to a few thousand drone bees, or males and tens of thousands of female worker bees.

==== Queen

Mating flight takes place:

* after the queen is fertile, and
* when the ambiant temperature is above 20.5 degrees, and
* when and there is little wind, and
* when the time of day is around or after noon 


==== Worker

Facts:

* Guard bees have the largest concentration of venom in their gland. 
* Guard bees require 1 .. 3 seconds to distinguish a bee from the hive from a foreign bee.

=== Life cycle

The bee goes through different phases in its life cycle: egg, larva, pupa, adult bee.


.Birth cycle of honey bees
[#img-birth-cylce] 
image::images/birth-cycle.jpg[Birth cycle]


*Egg* +
The queen lays eggs in cells made of beeswax inside the hive. The queen determines the gender of the bee before she lays the egg by fertilizing it or not. If the egg is fertilized, it will be female. If it is unfertilized is will me male. 

*Larva* +
The egg hatches into a larva after 3 days. The worker bees ensure the larva is fed and looked after. During this period, the larva will grow more than 1500 times its size. When after 6 days the larva reaches its full size and stretches upright in the cell, the top of the cell is sealed with bees wax in preparation for pupation.

*Pupa* + 
During this stage, the larva will shed its skins. Its eyes, legs and wings will develop along with the tiny hairs that cover the body. 

*Adult* +
On average, queen bees emerge from the egg in a total of 16 days, workers in 21 days and drones in 24 days. After emerging, new queen bees will fight among themselves until only one is left in the hive.

=== Nectar 

=== Honey

Honey is produced by bees who have collected nectar from vegitation or honeydew from other insects. Bees value honey for its sugars, which they consume to support general metabolic activity, especially that of their flight muscles during foraging, and as a food for their larvae. To this end bees stockpile honey to provide for themselves during ordinary foraging as well as during lean periods, as in overwintering.

During foraging bees use part of the nectar they collect to power their flight muscles. The majority of nectar collected is not used to directly nourish the insects but is instead destined for regurgitation, enzymatic digestion, followed by long-term storage as honey in the nest.

Nectar and honeydew consist out of suger, water and trace elements like minerals. The processed honey is required to have a water content percentage that is low enough to prevent the honey from spoiling. By bees regurgitating the nectar, the water in it evaporates and the honey becomes more sugar-concentrated. Once the honey reaches a water percentage below 20 percent, the cell containing the honey is capped with a lid. Capping the honey with a lid prevents the hydroscopic honey from absorbing humidity in the air.

=== Inspection

Goals of the inspection of the colony are:

1. Checking if the colony is queen-right
1. Checking if the colony has enough food storage
1. Checking if there is enough space for new food and new eggs
1. Checking if there are enough bees to care for and warm the brood
1. Checking if there are diseases in the colony

==== Check: queen right

The colony is queen right when:

* It contains a queen, and or
* It contains Brood In All Stadia (BRIAS): eggs, larvae and pupae


.Brood in all stadia (BRIAS)
[#img-brias] 
image::images/brias.jpg[brias]

==== Check: enough food storage

A healthy frame with brood contains a proper amount of food. 

*Plenty of jelly* +
The cells containing larvae should be filled with plenty of jelly inside it. This jelly is consumed by the larvae and required to stimulate a healthy growth.

If there is little or no jelly in the cells, this may indicate a food shortage. In that case, feeding with sugar water and / or pollen is beneficial. 

.Plenty of jelly
[#img-plenty-of-jelly] 
image::images/brood-with-plenty-jelly.png[Plenty of jelly]

*Plenty of pollen* +
The cells in between the brood, and especially around the brood should be filled with pollen inside it. The presence of pollen in the brood area stimulates nursing bees to consume it and produce jelly to feed the larvae. The pollen stored in between the brood is consumed first. The surplus brood is stored in a layer above the brood. 

If there is only little or no pollen in the cells, this may indicate a food shortage. In that case, feeding additional pollen is beneficial.

*Plenty of honey above the pollen* +
The cells above the layers of pollen should be filled with honey and / or nectar. 

If there is only little or no honey or nectar in the cells, this may indicate a food shortage. In that case, feeding sugar water is beneficial.
